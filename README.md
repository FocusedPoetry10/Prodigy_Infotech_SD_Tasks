# Prodigy Infotech Internship - Software Development Tasks

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I've documented the tasks I worked on during my internship at Prodigy Infotech. Over the course of this internship, I tackled five exciting projects that helped me grow my skills in software development. Here's an overview of each task:

## Table of Contents

1. [Task 1: Build a Temperature Conversion Program]
2. [Task 2: Create a Guessing Game]
3. [Task 3: Implement a Simple Contact Management System]
4. [Task 4: Implement a Sudoku Solver]
5. [Task 5: Web Scraping]
## Task 1: Build a Temperature Conversion Program

For my first task, I created a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The program asks the user to input a temperature value and its unit of measurement. Then, it converts the temperature to the other two units and displays the results. For instance, if you input 25 degrees Celsius, the program will convert it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin and show you the converted values.

## Task 2: Create a Guessing Game

The second task was to build a fun guessing game. The program generates a random number, and the user has to guess what it is. The game gives feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low and continues until the user guesses the correct number. It also keeps track of the number of attempts it took to get the right answer.

## Task 3: Implement a Simple Contact Management System

In this task, I developed a program for managing contact information. Users can add new contacts by entering names, phone numbers, and email addresses. They can also view their contact list, edit existing contacts, and delete contacts if needed. The program stores all the contact information in memory or in a file for future use.

## Task 4: Implement a Sudoku Solver

For the fourth task, I created a program that solves Sudoku puzzles automatically. You provide the program with an unsolved Sudoku grid, and it uses an algorithm (like backtracking) to fill in the missing numbers. Once the puzzle is solved, the program displays the completed grid.

## Task 5: Web Scraping

In the final task, I built a web scraping program to extract product information (like names, prices, and ratings) from an e-commerce website. The data is then stored in a CSV file. I chose a website for this purpose and wrote the script to scrape the relevant information.

## Conclusion

Working on these tasks during my internship at Prodigy Infotech has been an incredible learning experience. I've gained practical skills and a deeper understanding of software development. This repository showcases my journey and the projects I've completed. Feel free to explore the tasks and share your feedback!
